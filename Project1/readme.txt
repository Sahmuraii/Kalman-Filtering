All Periods of data are run through 1-100, 200-300, 1600-1700, 3000-3800.
More or less time_periods can be added by adding more values to the time_period array in (x,y) format. 
Figure1 is the Positional Data (Circle Graph)
Figure2 is Header Data 

Uncomment Lines 65 and 66 to add Noise to GPS Covariance Data for the entire set. 
	- See GPS_Co_Noise_All_Data_Figure1 and 2 for this result.

Uncomment from line 29 to 45 to add noise to GPS Covariance Data for certain periods.
	- See GPS_Co_Noise_Period_Data_Figure1 and 2 for this result.

Uncomment lines 73 and 74 to add Noise to IMU covariance data for the entire set.	
	- See IMU_Noise_All_Data_Figure1 and 2 for this result.

Uncomment from line 76 to 92 to add Noise to IMU covariance data for certain periods. 
	- See IMU_Noise_Period_Data_Figure1 and 2 For this result.

Uncomment Lines 25 and 26 to add Noise to positional data of GPS for entire set.
	- See GPS_Pos_Noise_All_Data_Figure1 and 2 for this result 
	- Note: Figures made with GPS Covariance Data run with entire set. Please see previous comments on how this is done.

Ucommet from line 47 to 63 to add Noise to postional data of GPS for certain periods.
	- See GPS_POS_Noise_Period_Data_Figure1 and 2 for this result 
	- Note: Figures made with GPS Covariance Data run with entire set. Please see previous comments on how this is done.

All Figures can be found in the Zipped up File.
